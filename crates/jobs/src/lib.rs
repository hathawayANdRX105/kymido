//! Background job registry for kymido.
//!
//! A *job* is work that must outlive the tool call which started it — a long
//! build, a training run, a server. The agent's tool call returns as soon as
//! the job is registered, and later tool calls poll (`list`), collect
//! (`wait`) or stop (`kill`) it.
//!
//! # Why jobs run on OS threads
//!
//! `orbit` calls `Tool::execute` synchronously on the engine thread (see the
//! tool-call loop in `crates/agent/orbit/src/lib.rs`). There is no async event
//! loop to park work on: the single `tokio` runtime in the workspace is a
//! private current-thread runtime owned by `SessionDb`. So a job is driven by
//! a `std::thread` it spawns, and the registry synchronises on plain `Mutex` +
//! `Condvar`. This mirrors how the MCP client (B1) was built — `std::thread` +
//! `mpsc` + `Mutex`, no new runtime.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//!            start()
//!              |
//!              v
//!          [running] --complete--> [completed]
//!              |  \-----fail-----> [failed]
//!              \--------kill()----> [killed]
//! ```
//!
//! `completed` / `failed` / `killed` are terminal; a terminal job keeps its
//! record (and captured output) so a `wait` after the fact still returns it.
