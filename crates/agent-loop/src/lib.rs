//! Agent-loop config carrier for the kymido harness.
//!
//! Holds only [`LoopEngine`], the runtime config the composition root
//! registers under `"harness.loop"`. The live agent loop is
//! `agent_loop::orbit::run_agent_streaming` (streaming, tool execution, compaction
//! bridge); this crate deliberately has no loop of its own, so there is a
//! single main-loop implementation. `daemon/rpc/worker.rs` reads
//! `max_turns` and `model` from the resolved engine to drive that loop.
//!
//! Reference: `dsh agent-loop`. The parallel non-streaming loop that once
//! lived here (`run_agent_loop` + `Provider`) was a dead second main loop
//! and was removed to keep the loop single-sourced.
