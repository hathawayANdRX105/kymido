//! Finding 4 (B1/B2 review) — the config loader's MCP `validate` warnings.
//!
//! `Config::validate` warns (stderr) but never rejects:
//!
//! 1. a server with **both** `url` and `command` — the mcp crate prefers the
//!    HTTP transport and silently ignores `command`;
//! 2. a `url` that does not start with `http(s)://` — the HTTP transport
//!    cannot dial it.
//!
//! The behavioural pin here is "still loads": the warnings go to stderr and
//! are not asserted, only the `Ok` outcome is.
//!
//! **These cases share one process-wide current directory.** `Config::load`
//! reads `./.kymido/config.toml` — resolved against the *process* cwd, since it
//! takes no directory argument — and `set_current_dir` is a property of the
//! process, not of a test. Three cases that each move the cwd and then load
//! therefore race each other when cargo runs them in parallel threads: the
//! writer's `set_current_dir` can be overwritten by a sibling's before its
//! own `load` reads, and the loader then opens a directory that never had
//! this case's entry. That is a defect of this harness, not of the loader,
//! so the cases serialize on a lock and each restores the cwd it found.

/// Serializes the cwd-switching cases below. The `set_current_dir` in
/// `load_with_mcp_server` is process-global, so two cases that overlap can
/// land the loader in a directory that is not the writer's.
///
/// A poisoned lock is taken rather than unwrapped: the cases assert on
/// config content, and one failing assertion must not turn the other two
/// into "poisoned lock" panics that say nothing about the config.
