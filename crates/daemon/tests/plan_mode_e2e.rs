//! Plan mode end-to-end through the real daemon socket.
//!
//! The observable contract, in order: `/plan` between turns flips plan mode
//! without an LLM round; a prompt under plan mode whose model turn calls
//! `exit_plan_mode` parks a plan-review question on the `user.question`
//! surface; `user.answer` with Approve resolves it, commits the exit, and
//! the follow-up request carries the tool result; plan mode reads back off.
//!
//! Only the full `Daemon::start` -> dispatch -> orbit engine -> plan-mode
//! plugin -> broker chain produces this sequence, so a pass here is the
//! batch's smoke: the feature works for a real client over a real socket.
