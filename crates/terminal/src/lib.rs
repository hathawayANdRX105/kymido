//! Persistent pty-backed terminal sessions.
//!
//! A `run_bash` call runs one command and dies with it: `cd` does not survive
//! to the next call, an interactive program cannot be driven, and a shell that
//! holds state (env, aliases, a REPL) is impossible. This crate keeps a real
//! pty session alive between tool calls, so the model can do
//! `terminal_create` → `terminal_write("cd /tmp")` → `terminal_write("pwd")`
//! and see `/tmp`.
//!
//! # Session lifetime
//!
//! Sessions live in a [`TerminalRegistry`] held by the daemon, not in the tool
//! call. Each session owns:
//!
//! * the pty master (read/write/resize),
//! * a **reader thread** that drains the pty master into an in-memory buffer.
//!
//! The reader thread is what makes `read` non-destructive and non-blocking:
//! the tool returns whatever has accumulated since the last read and never
//! stalls waiting for the shell to produce output. Without it a `read` on an
//! idle shell would block forever, which is exactly the failure mode this
//! crate exists to avoid.
//!
//! # Reading is a drain; the screen is a view of it
//!
//! [`TerminalRegistry::read`] returns the bytes captured since the previous
//! read and clears the buffer. It does *not* emulate a terminal: control
//! sequences pass through verbatim, and that is exactly the promise a
//! caller of `read` gets — bytes, not a picture.
//!
//! [`TerminalRegistry::screen`] is the picture. The same reader thread that
//! fills the buffer also runs the bytes through a VT emulator
//! ([`screen::Screen`]), so the two views never compete for the same bytes:
//! a `read` after a `screen` still returns everything the terminal produced
//! in between, and a `screen` shows the full picture regardless of what has
//! been read.
//!
//! Two consequences worth knowing before writing a caller:
//!
//! * **A pty echoes its input, and counting occurrences is not a fix.** Writing
//!   `echo hi\n` puts `hi` on the read side twice: once in the echoed command
//!   line, once as the command's output. The tempting workaround — "wait for
//!   two occurrences" — is *unreliable*, because the pty delivers bytes with no
//!   framing: the echoed line can itself arrive split across reads, and the
//!   marker is then counted from the echo twice before the command has produced
//!   anything. The caller returns early holding the echo and never sees the
//!   result.
//!
//!   The robust fix is to remove the ambiguity rather than count around it:
//!   have the shell assemble the sentinel from pieces so the literal never
//!   appears in the command text you wrote.
//!
//!   ```text
//!   printf '\n__DONE_%s__\n' OK      # literal "__DONE_OK__" is not in this line
//!   ```
//!
//!   Any occurrence of `__DONE_OK__` on the read side is then genuine output,
//!   and one occurrence is enough.
//! * **A full-screen TUI** (`vim`, `htop`) produces a stream of escape codes
//!   rather than a picture of the screen. That is what `read` hands back; for
//!   the picture itself use [`TerminalRegistry::screen`].
